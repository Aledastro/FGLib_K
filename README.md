FGLib is free open-source Kotlin game library, focused on developing 2D-games

Pros:

(*) Easy to Learn, Hard to Master

FGLib provides intuitive environment to work with and it easy to build simple games in it.
However, it has many powerful features if you know it well

(*) Open-Source and Free

Due to it open-source nature, you can modify FGLib functionality. And it not that hard,
because FGLib as your project is just raw kotlin project

(*) Powerful RoomEditor

Allows you to make levels easily

(*) Technology-Independent

FGLib is technology-independent and more about philosophy about how to make games.
It has different realisations for different purposes,
such as simple JavaAwt for lightweight apps or games, that can weight around 2MB,
raw OpenGL (work in progress) for complex games or
stable JavaFX, that keeps balance with performance and complexity.
All works in unite environment, so you can change realisation in two lines of code.
Of course, you can make your own realisations as well!

Cons:

(*) Many features are still in development, because I not need them currently

(*) Lack of documentation

(*) Limited in some ways

Developer: Uzery Studio (Alexander Kandrashkin)
